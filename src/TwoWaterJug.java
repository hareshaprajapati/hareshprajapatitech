 * You are at the side of a river. You are given a m litre jug and a n litre jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d litres of water where d < n. Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d litres of water in one of jug.
 The operations you can perform are:

 Empty a Jug
 Fill a Jug
 Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.

 Minimum number of steps required to major 4 litter using jug with litter 3 and jug with litter 5 is 6
